## Project: Structure of interactions and different models of ecological network
### Abstrct: Food web structure or system can refer simply to the number of trophic levels in a food chain or can represent the linkages within a complex food web network. Food webs, through direct and indirect interactions, describe the energy flow through an ecosystem. By tracking the energy flow, you can derive where the energy from your last meal came from, and how many species contributed to the meal. Understanding food webs can also help predict how important any given species is, and how ecosystems change by adding a new species or removing a current species. Through the various interactions in a food web, energy gets transferred from one organism to another; we want to explore the complexity of food webs in mathematical terms using a physical model, called a directed graph (digraph), to map the interactions between organisms. This study aims to create the corresponding competition (niche, cascade) overlap graph, and projection graphs to determine the dimensions of a communityâ€™s habitat. Moreover, this study also recognizes various relationships between organisms and looks for patterns in food webs. 

Keywords: directed graph, physical model, trophic level, patterns in food web.
